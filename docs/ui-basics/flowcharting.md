## Overview

A flow chart is a visual representation of steps in a process that are designed to result in a particular outcome. Flow charts are designed to communicate complex tasks at a glance and help managers identify how different departments in a company interact. Flowcharting is a useful tool if you want to improve your business' efficiency and productivity.[<sub>\[1\]</sub>](#references)

## Understanding Flowcharting

A flowchart is a step-by-step breakdown and graphic representation of a multifaceted process. The process in question can involve a single individual or several departments in a large corporation. Typically, every step in the process is represented with a box. Various boxes are then connected with arrows to each other. An arrow connecting box A and box B typically means that step A must be completed before step B can begin. For example, if the chart explains how a catering business should prepare a barbecue, two of the boxes might be labeled "light the fire" and "place meat on the grill". There will be an arrow going from the first box to the second box because the first step must be completed before the second is attempted.

The biggest benefit of flow charts is their ability to convey large quantities of information on a single page or screen. What would come across as an overwhelming quantity of data if put down on paper becomes manageable if represented on a flow chart. And by following the arrows, you can see how different systems and departments interact. Flowcharts can become even more useful by if you add color schemes different shapes. In a flowchart that describes how to prepare a barbecue, all blue steps might be one employee's responsibility, while all red steps could be someone else's.[<sub>\[1\]</sub>](#references)
