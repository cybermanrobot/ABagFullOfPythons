## What is Python?

Python is a widely-used general-purpose, dynamic, extensible, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.

As Python is a general-purpose language, its applicability in real-world software development covers an enormous spectrum of uses- the array and influence of Python is far and wide, from coding in an embedded language, to test automation, to building complex environments, to GUI design and development, to basic scripting. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. Python has fingerprints on countless modern-day technologies.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library. What this essentially means is that Python is an extremely versatile, efficient language, and while it can be difficult to learn, it is definitely a language worth exploring. With sophisticated coding languages, the last thing a programmer should do is dive into the deep end without first familiarising themselves with the fundamentals of the language. Python is an investment, in time and effort, as well as a programmer investing in themselves for the sake of improving their employment prospects.

## Why Use Python?

Some of the advantages of Python:

*   Presence of third-party modules
*   Extensive support libraries (NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics etc)
*   Open source and community development
*   Easy to learn
*   User-friendly data structures
*   High-level language
*   Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on value assigned, it takes data type)
*   Object-oriented language
*   Portable and Interactive
*   Portable across Operating systems

## How is Python Used?

Dynamic Typing, Built-In Data Structures, Powerful Libraries, Frameworks, Community Support are just some of the reasons which make Python an attractive language for rapidly developing any sort of application. It supports cross-platform operating systems which makes building applications with it all the more convenient. The language has been around since 1991 but has surged in the following areas:

*   Web Development
*   Game Development
*   Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
*   Data Science and Data Visualization
*   Desktop GUI
*   Web Scraping Applications
*   Business Applications
*   Audio and Video Applications
*   CAD Applications
*   Embedded Applications

## What Notable Companies Use Python?

Reddit
*   Recoded their media platform in Python due to its wider range of code libraries and was more developmentally flexible.

Instagram
*   The social media platform is built in Python and runs on the Django web framework.

Spotify
*   Uses Python for it's back-end media services and accounts for 80% of it services platform. Also uses Python for their data analytics purposes.

Survey Monkey
*   Rewrote their platform in Python for the language simplicity and wide range of libraries and tools.

Facebook
*   Uses Python to handle image services.

Netflix
*   Uses Python for their data analytics purposes.

## Is the Python the Best Language?

While Python has many use cases, saying it is the best language is a matter of opinion. When choosing any programming language to develop any application, there are several, tens or hundreds of factors that you should consider. Purpose, experience, ease of development, and suitability should weigh on your decision. One of the disadvantages of Python is that it sacrifices performance for usability. If your application is speed intensive, then Python is not the best choice. Another disadvantage is limited features for the mobile platform.

If your new to programming, Python is easy to install, and you can get started quickly. There is an unlimited amount of resources at your disposal to help you with your programming journey.
