# Python-Specific IDEs
{: .no_toc }

## PyCharm
Website: [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

One of the best (and only) full-featured, dedicated IDEs for Python is PyCharm. Available in both paid (Professional) and free open-source (Community) editions, PyCharm installs quickly and easily on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

Out of the box, PyCharm supports Python development directly. You can just open a new file and start writing code. You can run and debug Python directly inside PyCharm, and it has support for source control and projects.

**Pros**: It’s the de facto Python IDE environment, with tons of support and a supportive community. It edits, runs, and debugs Python out of the box.

**Cons**: PyCharm can be slow to load, and the default settings may need tweaking for existing projects.


## Spyder
Website: [https://www.spyder-ide.org/](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
Anaconda Package: [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Spyder is an open-source Python IDE that’s optimized for data science workflows. Spyder comes included with the Anaconda package manager distribution, so depending on your setup you may already have it installed on your machine.

What’s interesting about Spyder is that it’s target audience is data scientists using Python. You’ll notice this throughout. For example, Spyder integrates well with common Python data science libraries like SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

Spyder features most of the “common IDE features” you might expect, such as a code editor with robust syntax highlighting, Python code completion, and even an integrated documentation browser.

A special feature that I haven’t seen in other Python editing environments is Spyder’s “variable explorer” that allows you to display data using a table-based layout right inside your IDE. Personally, I usually don’t have a need for this but it does look neat. If you regularly do data science work using Python, you might fall in love with this unique feature. The IPython/Jupyter integration is nice as well.

Overall, I’d say that Spyder feels more basic than other IDEs. I like to view it more as a special purpose tool rather than something I use as my primary editing environment every day. What is nice about this Python IDE is that it is available for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux and that it is fully open-source software.

**Pros**: You’re a data scientist using the Anaconda Python distribution.

**Cons**: More experienced Python developers might find Spyder too basic to work with on a daily basis and instead opt for a more complete IDE or customized editor solution.
