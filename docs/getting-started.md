## Mission for A Full Bag of Pythons

The mission for this site is to provide information and resources to any individual wanting to learn computer programming using the Python programming language. Content has been written for beginners with limited to no programming experience or individuals that are new to Python.

## What is "Computer Programming"?

Understanding the concept of Computer Programming will come easy to some people but not so easy to others, it all depends on your experience. To put it quite simply, Computer Programming is the process of writing the source code for an applications. The source code is written in a Programming Language. This code will tell the application to carry out a task depending on what code has been written. It is used a lot in the business industry to automate tasks and save time. If you don’t quite understand, then think about training a dog to sit. You can program the dog to sit when you say the word “sit”, just like you could program an application to add two numbers together when you click a button.

The basic concept of computer programming can be explained in many different ways, so many that you could be here for another week reading them! Just think about the way that it has been explained here and then take a look at some of the applications on your computer. They all carry out tasks when you click something or do something, they have been programmed to do that in a particular programming language. Some will be more complicated than others but they will all be made up of source code. If you still don’t fully understand the concept of Computer Programming then don’t worry, as you learn your first language you will start to understand it more.

## Where to start?

If your new to programming, you should start by reviewing the concepts listed under Programming Basics While every language has its own syntax or set of rules for implementation, all languages will share basic coding principles. If you have a grasp on the fundamentals then proceed to [Python Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/overview.md %}) to get some background about the language.
