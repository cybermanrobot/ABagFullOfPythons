## Installing the Python Interpreter

Before jumping into coding, you will need to download and install the Python interpreter to your local storage. The install package contains the base files and the IDLE editor, which is a lightweight code editor to create and execute Python scripts. The installation process is quick and straightforward. For step-by-step instructions, consult the [Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com). Just locate and click your desired operating system.

Be sure to check the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" box!

## (Optional) Installing the Anaconda Suite

If you're interested in Data Analytics, you should consider installing Anaconda. The free software is complete analytics solutions that package the Python interpreter with an IDE (Spyder), a web-based collaborative editor (Jupyter Notebooks) all the popular Python libraries associated with Data Science and Machine Learning.

If you have already installed a Python interpreter, Ananconda is not required. You can install Anaconda without compromising other Python installations. The suite maintains a segregated environment to prevent library and module conflicts.

The installation process is quick and straightforward. For step-by-step instructions, consult the [Installation Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on [andaconda.com](https://andaconda.com). Just locate and click your desired operating system.
